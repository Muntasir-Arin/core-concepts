# Project Management Best Practices

Here's a comprehensive guide for project management best practices, focusing on JIRA ticket templates and essential
management components:

### ðŸŽ¯ JIRA Ticket Templates

#### 1. **Story Template**

```markdown
[Story] Short descriptive title

**Business Value**
As a [user role]
I want to [feature/action]
So that [benefit/value]

**Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Criteria 1
- [ ] Criteria 2
- [ ] Criteria 3

**Technical Notes**

- Implementation details
- API endpoints affected
- Database changes

**Story Points**: [1,2,3,5,8,13]
```

#### 2. **Bug Template**

```markdown
[Bug] Concise bug description

**Current Behavior**

- What is happening now

**Expected Behavior**

- What should happen

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. Step 1
2. Step 2
3. Step 3

**Environment**

- OS:
- Browser/Version:
- App Version:

**Screenshots/Logs**

- Attach relevant images/logs

**Severity**: [Blocker/Critical/Major/Minor]
```

#### 3. **Task Template**

```markdown
[Task] Technical task description

**Objective**
Clear statement of what needs to be done

**Technical Details**

- Architecture changes
- Dependencies
- Security considerations

**Definition of Done**

- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Tests written
- [ ] Documentation updated

**Estimated Time**: [hours/days]
```

### ðŸ“Š Project Management Essentials

#### 1. **Sprint Structure**

```markdown
Sprint Duration: 2 weeks
Ceremonies:

- Sprint Planning (2 hours)
- Daily Standup (15 mins)
- Sprint Review (1 hour)
- Sprint Retrospective (1 hour)
- Backlog Refinement (1 hour/week)
```

#### 2. **Priority Levels**

```markdown
P0 - Blocker/Critical
P1 - High Priority
P2 - Medium Priority
P3 - Low Priority
P4 - Nice to have
```

#### 3. **Status Workflow**

```markdown
To Do â†’ In Progress â†’ Code Review â†’ QA â†’ Done

Additional Statuses:

- Blocked
- On Hold
- Ready for Deploy
```

#### 4. **Labels/Tags**

```markdown
Type:

- feature
- bug
- tech-debt
- security

Component:

- frontend
- backend
- database
- infrastructure

Release:

- sprint-x
- v1.x.x
- hotfix
```

#### 5. **Definition of Ready (DoR)**

```markdown
- [ ] User story is clear and follows template
- [ ] Acceptance criteria defined
- [ ] Dependencies identified
- [ ] Story points estimated
- [ ] Design/mockups attached (if UI work)
- [ ] Technical approach agreed upon
```

#### 6. **Definition of Done (DoD)**

```markdown
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Unit tests written (>80% coverage)
- [ ] Code reviewed by 2 peers
- [ ] Integration tests passed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging
- [ ] QA approved
- [ ] Performance metrics verified
```

### ðŸ“ˆ Reporting Metrics

#### 1. **Sprint Metrics**

```markdown
- Velocity
- Sprint burndown
- Cycle time
- Lead time
- Sprint completion rate
```

#### 2. **Quality Metrics**

```markdown
- Bug escape rate
- Code coverage
- Technical debt ratio
- Failed deployments
- Production incidents
```

### ðŸ”„ Release Management

```markdown
Release Types:

1. Major (x.0.0) - Breaking changes
2. Minor (1.x.0) - New features
3. Patch (1.0.x) - Bug fixes

Release Checklist:

- [ ] Release notes prepared
- [ ] Database migrations tested
- [ ] Rollback plan documented
- [ ] Performance tests passed
- [ ] Security scan completed
- [ ] Stakeholders notified
```

### ðŸ“± Communication Channels

```markdown
1. JIRA - Task tracking and project management
2. Slack/Teams - Daily communication
3. Confluence/Wiki - Documentation
4. Email - Formal communications
5. Git - Code repository
6. CI/CD Pipeline - Build and deployment status
```

### ðŸš€ Best Practices

```markdown
1. Regular backlog grooming
2. Strict PR review process
3. Automated testing requirements
4. Documentation as code
5. Monitoring and alerting setup
6. Regular security audits
7. Performance benchmarking
8. Technical debt tracking
