# Computer Science Fundamental Core Concepts and Problem-Solving

This repository is a curated collection of **core computer science concepts** and **algorithmic problem-solving techniques** implemented in Java, Kotlin, Python and C++. It is designed for learners and professionals aiming to strengthen their understanding of the JVM, OOP, concurrency, and practical coding interview problems.

## üìå Topics & Structure

### **Core Concepts**
- **Java & OOP**: JVM internals, memory management, garbage collection, class loading, generics, and type safety.
- **Concurrency**: Thread safety, synchronization, locks, thread pools, deadlocks, and race conditions.

### **Problem Solving**
- **Algorithmic Challenges**: Well-documented Java solutions to common problems (e.g., LeetCode), such as Longest Common Subsequence.

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Layout
